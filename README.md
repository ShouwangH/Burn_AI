### Example Output

**Image**: *A sepia-toned photograph of a worn lunch pail resting on a factory windowsill, circa 1943*

**Narration**: *"The lunch pail sits where Thomas Murphy left it, that Tuesday afternoon when the shift whistle called. Inside, half a sandwich his wife Mary wrapped at dawn, the wax paper folded with the same precise corners she'd learned from her mother. This simple meal‚Äîbologna on white bread‚Äîwould fuel another eight hours at the munitions line. Democracy, it turns out, travels in lunch pails as much as in declarations."*
